# Github and DS4PP
Throughout the course you will use github to submit homework. 

Github provides online storage with version control using software called `git`. Everytime you commit to a change, `git` tracks those changes. This is useful when you want to go back to look at old work without storing multiple copies of a file & also allows for sophisticated collaboration on shared files.

# Using the `pset_template.Rmd`
1.  You have three options for working with github. As you go down the list, the user has less control, but an easier entry point.
    1. `git` throught the command line to clone this repository. (http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
    1. Use github desktop. (https://desktop.github.com/)
    (It is possible to use the website directly for some early assignments, but we do not recommend this because later in the semester there will be assignments for which this will not be possible.)

1. Rename the file as directed by the homework.
1. Delete the html file from your repository.
