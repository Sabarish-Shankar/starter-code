# Github and DS4PP
Throughout the course you will use github to submit homework. 

Github provides online storage with version control using software called `git`. Everytime you commit to a change, `git` tracks those changes. This is useful when you want to go back to look at old work without storing multiple copies of a file & also allows for sophisticated collaboration on shared files.
