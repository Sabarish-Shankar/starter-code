# Github and DS4PP
Throughout the course you will use github to submit homework. 

Github provides online storage with version control using software called `git`. Everytime you commit to a change, `git` tracks those changes and allows you to look at older versions and collaborate with others on the same files.

# Using the `pset_template.Rmd`
1. Use github desktop or `git` throught the command line to clone this repository. (You can also download the file directly. Eventually you will need to push your work back to github, so it's better to get that working now!).
1. Rename the file as directed by the homework.
1. Delete the html file from your repository.
