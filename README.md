# Github and DS4PP
Throughout the course you will use github to submit homework. 

Github provides online storage with version control using software called `git`. Everytime you commit to a change, `git` tracks those changes. This is useful when you want to go back to look at old work without storing multiple copies of a file & also allows for sophisticated collaboration on shared files.

# Using the `pset_template.Rmd`
1.  Use `git` through the command line to clone this repository. [Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). (We recommend that you do not clone or upload using github desktop nor the website because later in the semester there will be assignments for which this will not be possible.)
1. Rename the file as directed by the homework.
1. Delete the html file from your repository.
